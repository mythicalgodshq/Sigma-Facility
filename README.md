# Sigma-Facility
Sigma Facility is a hide and seek Counter Strike 2 map set in an old forgotten soviet research center.

There should be everything included. You can just mount the .vmap file into hammer or you can drop the "content" folder into your CS2 installation folder and mount it from there. Both should work. 
If you have any questions, message me on steam (steamcommunity.com/id/mythicalgods) or on Discord (mythicalgods). Thanks :) 
I've also included some WIP screenshots.

Use the map to learn, experiment, or copy existing elements onto your own map, just make sure to credit me.
